        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Flour: This sweet cornbread recipe starts with a cup of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Cornmeal: Opt for yellow cornmeal for this recipe, as it's sweeter than its white counterpart.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Use â…” cup white sugar for the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cornbread rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A teaspoon of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Milk: Use whole milk, 2% milk, or your favorite alternative milk to add moisture and help create the perfect batter consistency.</li>
            <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, keeps the cornbread nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Egg: One egg lends moisture and acts as a binding agent.</li>
